            <p>I remember our last conversation aboutâ€”you told me I was desperate for it. And you were right. But what I was really desperate for was <i>your</i> love.</p>
            <p>Six years was a long time, long enough that I almos forgot you. But I guess the universe had other plans. SOmehow, it decided it was time to remind me who my heart truly longed for all this timeâ€”you. I can't believe it's already been a month
                since we took that leap into the unknown together. I never expected love to feel so natural, so effortless,. And honestly, it still feels like a miracle that I found my way to you.
            </p>
            <p>Even though we've only known each other for a short time and there are miles between us, my heart is always with you. You've brought a kind of warmth, kindness, and love into my life that I've never felt before, and I cherish every moment we shared.
                Since meeting you, I find myself glued to my phone 24/7, hoping every notification is from youâ€”liking my stories, saying hello, or asking to call. And even though we've only went out twice, it was more than enough to make me miss feeling your warmth and loveâ€”
                something I've been searching for all along.
            </p>
            
            <p>I love you so much, bubby, and I can't wait for the day I get to hold you in my arms again, feel your heartbeat, and feel that warmth once more. I miss you every second, and by every second I love you even more.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Happy one-month, bubby. Here's to many more calls, memories, jokes, and dreams we'll create together in the next seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years ahead.ðŸ’•ðŸ’•</p>
            <p>Rakastan sinua niin paljon, ettÃ¤ maailma ei ole tarpeeksi suuri sille.</p>
            <p>Forever yours,</p>
            <p><strong>Antoinne</strong></p>
