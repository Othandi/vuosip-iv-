            Wow it's actually been a month now since you and I decided to jump into the unknown together. I didn't expect that a person can make love something feel so... natural. 
            Although we've only known each for a short time and we're also miles apart, my heart is always with you. You brought warmth, love, kindness and support that meant the world to me.
            I will always always alwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaays cherish every moment we share.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love you so much, mahal. I'm so keen for the day where I get to hug you tightly in my arms again, hear your heartbeat, and feel your warmth. I miss you so much.
            Happy one-month anniversary, mahal. Here's to many more calls, memories, and dreams that we'll share together in the coming days, months and years. ðŸ’žðŸ’ž

            Rakastan sinua niin paljon, ettÃ¤ maailma ei ole tarpeeksi suuri sille.
        </p>
        <p>Forever yours,</p>
        <p><strong>Antoinne</strong></p>
