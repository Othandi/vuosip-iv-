            <p>Wow it's actually been a month now since you and I decided to jump into the unknown together. I didn't expect that a person can make love something feel so... natural. Although we've only known each other for a short time and we're also miles apart, my heart is always with you. You brought warmth, love, kindness and support that now means the world to me. I will always always cherish every moment we share.</p>
            <p>I love you so much, mahal. Can't wait for the day where I get to hug you tightly in my arms again, hear your heartbeat, and feel your warmth. I miss you so much. I love you so much.</p>
            <p class="highlight">Happy one-month anniversary, mahal. Here's to many more calls, memories, and dreams that we'll share together in the coming days, months and years. 💕💕</p>
            <p>Rakastan sinua niin paljon, että maailma ei ole tarpeeksi suuri sille.</p>
            <p>Forever yours,</p>
            <p><strong>Antoinne</strong></p>
